**Discover Finance Hints Through Social Media & Stock Data**

## Getting Started:

- `brew install postgres`         _Install Postgres through Brew_
- `brew services start postgres`  _Start Postgres via Brew_
- `make full-install`             _Setup and Populate Database_

After these steps are completed you will have a database populated with
top finance figures on Twitter (as suggested by Business Insider) and 150 recent
posts from each. For an example of data pertaining to more specific financial
analysis, 2+ years of stock pricing information for 7 selected companies will be
inserted into the database as well.

All of the information described above is available via API for easy integration
with applications designed for data analysis. Examples of API
interactions are shown below.

## API Server:

Launch server with `make server`

API returns results as a JSON array of objects. Example:
